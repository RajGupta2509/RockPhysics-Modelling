## 🧪 Objectives

This project focuses on core rock physics tasks using experimental chalk data:

- 📊 **Calculate Porosity**  
  Using measured **bulk, grain, and fluid densities**.

- 📉 **Model Stress-Depth Trends**  
  Compute **differential** and **effective stress** with depth.

- 📈 **Estimate Elastic Moduli**  
  Derive **bulk** and **shear modulus** from measured properties.

- ⚖️ **Apply Rock Physics Bounds**  
  Use **Voigt-Reuss-Hill** and **Hashin-Shtrikman** models to constrain elastic parameters.

- 🌊 **Gassmann Fluid Substitution**  
  Predict **P-wave (Vp)** and **S-wave (Vs)** velocities for different fluid saturation scenarios.

- 🔍 **Cross-Property Plotting**  
  Visualize relationships between porosity, velocity, and moduli to validate theoretical predictions.
